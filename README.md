## Graph Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of various Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, including Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT), using the PyTorch Geometric library. The models are trained and tested on the Cora dataset, a standard benchmark for node classification tasks in graph learning.

### Key Features:
- **GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT Models**: Implementations of three different GNN architectures with two-layer configurations.
- **MLP Model**: A baseline Multi-Layer Perceptron model for comparison.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Code to train models and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **PCA Visualization**: Visualize node embeddings in 2D space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

This project demonstrates the application of GNNs to node classification tasks and provides tools for visualizing and evaluating the learned node embeddings.
